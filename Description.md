Description of Employee Attrition
Employee attrition refers to the gradual reduction of a company's workforce due to employees leaving the organization voluntarily or involuntarily. Attrition is a critical metric for organizations, as it reflects turnover rates and can indicate employee dissatisfaction, poor job fit, lack of career development opportunities, or external factors such as competitive job offers. Analyzing employee attrition helps companies identify underlying reasons for employees leaving and provides actionable insights to improve retention strategies, enhance job satisfaction, and boost employee engagement.

Description of the Analysis
The employee attrition analysis was performed using a CSV dataset containing detailed employee information such as demographics, salary, job roles, department, distance from home, and whether they left the company or stayed. We used MySQL to query and analyze the data, which enabled us to examine the relationship between various factors and employee attrition.
